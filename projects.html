        Database Project
    </h2>
    <p>
      Created a database for my project during the Database Management class I took in my second semester of Sophomore Year.
      The scope of my database was to create a system to keep track of all the transactions of iCrave Design
      (an interior design company with its main branch in New York, USA.)
    </p>
    <p>
      This database was to enable them manage data arising from their everyday business operations to allow them to make wiser business decisions in the future.
      Another purpose of the database was to help with the elimination of errors through process automation and saving time which could be used to focus on the other tasks.
